- bidirectional communication protocol between client and server over the web
- standardized in 2011
- completely compatible with HTTP
- stateful
- built on HTTP 1.1
- it is a stateful
- once the connection is established, either client or server can send data.
- persistent connection
- you can create your own WebSocket or you can use WebSocket library

WebSockets handleshake
ws:// -> http
wss:// -> over tls (secured)

1. client -> server : HTTP GET 1.1 request with header is UPGRADE
2. server -> client : if it supports ws, then status code 101 - switching protocols

Sec-WebSocket-Key
- The `Sec-WebSocket-Key` header plays a crucial role in the WebSocket handshake process, handshake acts as a verification mechanism, ensuring a secure and reliable connection between the client and the WebSocket server.
- The server 
	- concatenates the received `Sec-WebSocket-Key` with a well-known GUID `("258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11")`.
	- It applies the ***SHA-1 hashing algorithm*** to this combined string.
	- Finally, it base64 encodes the hashed value.
- Security Benefits:
	- **Prevents Malicious Requests:** By requiring a random challenge and verifying the response, the server guards against non-WebSocket clients attempting to connect using standard HTTP methods.
	- **Mitigates Spoofing:** The use of a random key and a specific GUID makes it difficult for attackers to spoof legitimate WebSocket requests.

WebSockets use cases
- chatting
- live feed
- multiplayer gaming
- showing client progress/logging
