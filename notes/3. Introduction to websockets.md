- bidirectional communication protocol between client and server over the web
- standardized in 2011
- completely compatible with HTTP
- stateful
- built on HTTP 1.1
- it is a stateful
- once the connection is established, either client or server can send data.
- persistent connection
- you can create your own WebSocket or you can use WebSocket library

WebSockets handleshake
ws:// -> http
wss:// -> over tls (secured)


![[websocket_handshake_1.png]]



1. client -> server : HTTP GET 1.1 request with header is UPGRADE
2. server -> client : if it supports ws, then status code 101 - switching protocols

Sec-WebSocket-Key
- The `Sec-WebSocket-Key` header plays a crucial role in the WebSocket handshake process, handshake acts as a verification mechanism, ensuring a secure and reliable connection between the client and the WebSocket server.
- The server 
	- concatenates the received `Sec-WebSocket-Key` with a well-known GUID `("258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11")`.
	- It applies the ***SHA-1 hashing algorithm*** to this combined string.
	- Finally, it base64 encodes the hashed value.
- Security Benefits:
	- **Prevents Malicious Requests:** By requiring a random challenge and verifying the response, the server guards against non-WebSocket clients attempting to connect using standard HTTP methods.
	- **Mitigates Spoofing:** The use of a random key and a specific GUID makes it difficult for attackers to spoof legitimate WebSocket requests.

WebSockets use cases
- chatting
- live feed
- multiplayer gaming
- showing client progress/logging

**Note:** Stateful applications are not horizontally scalable.

Demo code

server `index.js`
```js
const http = require("http");
const WebSocketServer = require("websocket").server;


let connection = null;

// http server has a socket 
const httpServer = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    console.log("we have received request");
});

const websocket = new WebSocketServer({
    httpServer
});

websocket.on("request", request => {
    connection = request.accept(null, request.origin);
    connection.on("open", () => {
        console.log("Opened!!");
    });
    connection.on("close", () => console.log("Closed!!"));
    connection.on("message", message => console.log(`received message ${message.utf8Data}`));
    sendEvery5seconds();
});

function sendEvery5seconds() {
    connection.send(`Message ${Math.random()}`);
    setTimeout(sendEvery5seconds, 5000);
}

httpServer.listen(8080, () => console.log("listening on port 8080"));
```

install package
`npm install websocket`

to run
`node index.js`

from server
`connection.send("hello from client")`


client
from the browser console,
```js
let ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080");
ws.onmessage = message => console.log(`We received a message from a server ${message.data}`);
ws.send("hello from client")

//to close the connection
ws.close()
```
